The C Code Archive Network

WARNING: The previous website (ccodearchive dot net) has, alas, been
taken over by domain squatters who have an out of date copy of the
site with sneaky ad links added.

You can find a set of helper utilities under tools/ and the modules
under ccan/.  The recommended way to add ccan modules to your project
is to create a ccan/ directory and add one module per subdirectory
(see tools/create-ccan-tree).

Enjoy!
